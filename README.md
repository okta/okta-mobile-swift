**Table of Contents**

<!-- TOC depthFrom:2 depthTo:3 -->
<!-- /TOC -->

## Release status

This library uses semantic versioning and follows Okta's [Library Version Policy][okta-library-versioning].

| Version | Status                             |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0.1.0   | ✔️ Beta                             |

The latest release can always be found on the [releases page][github-releases].

## Need help?
 
If you run into problems using the SDK, you can:
 
* Ask questions on the [Okta Developer Forums][devforum]
* Post [issues][github-issues] here on GitHub (for code errors)

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need:

* An Okta account, called an _organization_ (sign up for a free [developer organization](https://developer.okta.com/signup) if you need one).
* An Okta Application, configured as a Native App. This is done from the Okta Developer Console. When following the wizard, use the default properties. They are designed to work with our sample applications.
* Xcode 13.x, targeting one of the supported platforms and target versions (see the [Support Policy][support-policy] below).

## Install

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following to the `dependencies` attribute defined in your `Package.swift` file. You can select the version using the `majorVersion` and `minor` parameters. For example:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .Package(url: "https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift.git", majorVersion: <majorVersion>, minor: <minor>)
]
```

## Usage Guide

This SDK consists of several different libraries, each with their own detailed documentation.

- AuthFoundation -- Common classes for managing credentials, and used as a foundation for other libraries.
- OktaOAuth2 -- OAuth2 authentication capabilities for authenticating users.
- WebAuthenticationUI -- Authenticate users using web-based OIDC flows.

The use of this SDK enables you to build or support a myriad of different authentication flows and approaches. To simplify getting started, here are a few samples to demonstrate its usage.

### Web Authentication using OIDC

The simplest way to integrate authentication in your app is with OIDC through a web browser, using the Authorization Code Flow grant.

#### Configure your OIDC Settings

Before authenticating your user, you need to create your client configuration using the settings defined in your application in the Okta Developer Console. The simplest approach is to use a `Okta.plist` configuration file to specify these settings. Ensure one is created with the following fields:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>issuer</key>
    <string>https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default</string>
    <key>clientId</key>
    <string>{clientId}</string>
    <key>redirectUri</key>
    <string>{redirectUri}</string>
    <key>logoutRedirectUri</key>
    <string>{logoutRedirectUri}</string>
    <key>scopes</key>
    <string>openid profile offline_access</string>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

Alternatively, you can supply those values to the constructor the `WebAuthentication` we're about to discuss in the next section.

#### Create a Web Authentication session

Once you've configured your application settings within your `Okta.plist` file, a shared configuration will automatically be made available through the `WebAuthentication.shared` singleton property. With that in place, you can use the convenience `WebAuthentication.signIn(from:)` method to prompt the user to sign in.

```swift
import WebAuthenticationUI

func signIn() async {
    let token = try await WebAuthentication.signIn(from: view.window)
    let credential = Credential.for(token: token)
}
```

The `signIn(from:)` function will return a token and, by using the `Credential` class, you can save the token and use it within your application.

## Development

### Running Tests

## Support Policy

This policy defines the extent of the support for Xcode, Swift, and platform (iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS) versions.

### Xcode

The only supported versions of Xcode are those that can be currently used to submit apps to the App Store. Once a Xcode version becomes unsupported, dropping support for it will not be considered a breaking change, and will be done in a minor release.

### Swift

The minimum supported Swift 5 minor version is the one released with the oldest-supported Xcode version. Once a Swift 5 minor becomes unsupported, dropping support for it will not be considered a breaking change, and will be done in a minor release.

### Platforms

Only the last 4 major platform versions are officially supported, starting from:

- iOS 12
- macOS 10.15
- Catalyst 13
- tvOS 12
- watchOS 6.2

Once a platform version becomes unsupported, dropping support for it will not be considered a breaking change, and will be done in a minor release. E.g. iOS 12 will cease to be supported when iOS 16 gets released, and might be dropped in a minor release.

In the case of macOS, the yearly named releases are considered a major platform version for the purposes of this Policy, regardless of the actual version numbers.

> *Note:* Older OS versions will be supported in a best-effort manner. Unless there are API limitations that prevent the SDK from working effectively on older OS versions, the minimum requirements will not be changed.
> 
> Additionally, Linux compatibility is considered best-effort, and is not officially supported.

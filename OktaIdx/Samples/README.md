# Samples

These samples show you how to add different ways to sign-in a user, called authentication workflows to your app. Each sample shows code for both implementing and testing the workflow.

## Using the Samples

These samples are designed to be built and run from the `OktaIdx` workspace. To use them outside of the workspace:

1. Copy the sample folder to the desired location.
2. Copy the `Shared` folder to the same location at the same level as the sample folder.
3. Open the sample project in Xcode.
4. Select the project and add the Okta Idx and Okta Swift Mobile SDK Swift Packages.
